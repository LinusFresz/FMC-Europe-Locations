This script is using the WCA WCIF and  provides registration information for FMC Europe 2019.

By using the WCA website for registrations, no location-specific information about all registered and accepted competitors can be shown. This script groups all competitors by all locations and collects mail addresses sorted by locations to let delegates mail their competitors.
